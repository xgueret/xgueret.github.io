## Introduction

As a self-hosting enthusiast with a passion for infrastructure management, I created the [HomeLab](https://github.com/xgueret/HomeLab) project on GitHub. This project is designed to automate the deployment of a Proxmox server and set up a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster using **kubeadm**, with the support of **Terraform** and **Ansible** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Additionally, the project includes steps for setting up **k9s** to manage the Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview of HomeLab

HomeLab was born out of my need to streamline the deployment and management of a robust home infrastructure. The project focuses on automating the setup of a **Proxmox** server, which serves as the foundation for running virtual machines (VMs) and containers. From there, the goal is to deploy a **Kubernetes** cluster using **kubeadm**, with **Terraform** and **Ansible** handling the provisioning and configuration of the infrastructure.

Here's a breakdown of the key technologies used in HomeLab:

- **Proxmox**: Acts as the hypervisor for managing virtual machines and containers, providing a flexible and scalable environment for running services.
  
- **Ansible**: Automates the configuration and management of servers, ensuring that the environment is consistently and correctly set up.
  
- **Terraform**: Manages infrastructure as code, automating the provisioning of Proxmox resources and the Kubernetes cluster.
  
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Orchestrates containerized applications, providing a robust platform for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized workloads.
  
- **kubeadm**: Simplifies the setup of a Kubernetes cluster, handling the initialization and configuration of the control plane and worker nodes.
  
- **k9s**: Provides a terminal-based UI for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster, making it easier to manage and monitor your workloads.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of HomeLab is to provide an automated, repeatable way to set up a powerful and flexible home infrastructure. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. **Deploy a Proxmox Server**: Use Proxmox as the base for running VMs and containers, providing a versatile and efficient platform for your home lab.

2. **Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster**: Leverage kubeadm to initialize and configure a Kubernetes cluster on the Proxmox VMs, enabling the deployment and management of containerized applications.

3. **Utilize Terraform and Ansible**: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision the Proxmox resources and Ansible to automate the configuration of the environment, ensuring consistency and reducing manual intervention.

4. **Implement k9s**: Provide a powerful and user-friendly terminal UI for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster, simplifying cluster management.

## Open to Contributions

HomeLab is an open-source project, and I warmly welcome contributions from the community. Whether you want to add new features, improve existing ones, or simply help with documentation, your input is highly valued.

If you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork the repository on GitHub and submit a pull request. You can also open issues if you encounter any bugs or have ideas for enhancements.

## Conclusion

The HomeLab project is a comprehensive solution for anyone looking to deploy a Proxmox server and set up a Kubernetes cluster with a focus on automation and ease of management. By making this project public on GitHub, I hope to share the benefits of this setup with others who are passionate about self-hosting and infrastructure management.

If you want to learn more, try out HomeLab, or contribute to the project, I invite you to check out the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/xgueret/HomeLab). I look forward to your feedback and contributions to further improve this project.
