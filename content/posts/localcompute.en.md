## Introduction

The [Local Compute](https://github.com/xgueret/local-compute) project on GitHub is designed to streamline local data processing tasks with a simple yet powerful tool that you can run directly on your machine.

## Overview of Local Compute

Local Compute was created to address the need for a practical and efficient way to set up a PC. It provides a set of tools and a bash script (`local_laptop.sh`) that facilitates the execution and management of tasks. The script automates the execution of Ansible playbooks within a Python virtual environment, ensuring that the necessary dependencies are correctly managed and isolated.

Hereâ€™s a summary of what Local Compute offers:

- **Local Execution**: Perform calculations and manage tasks directly on your local machine, reducing reliance on external infrastructure.
- **Ansible Integration**: The `local_laptop.sh` script uses Ansible to automate various computational and configuration tasks, making it easier to manage complex workflows.
- **Python Virtual Environment**: The script sets up and activates a Python virtual environment (`venv`) for running Ansible commands, ensuring that all dependencies are managed in an isolated environment. After the tasks are completed, the virtual environment is deactivated.
- **Simplicity and Flexibility**: Customize the bash script and Ansible playbooks to meet your specific needs, offering a versatile solution for various data processing tasks.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of Local Compute are to:

1. **Enable Local Computation**: Provide a straightforward method for performing heavy computations locally without relying on cloud-based solutions.
2. **Automate with Ansible**: Use Ansible to handle complex tasks and configurations, making the process more efficient and manageable.
3. **Manage Dependencies with Python venv**: Leverage a Python virtual environment to ensure that all dependencies for Ansible are correctly managed and isolated during execution.
4. **Simplify Task Automation**: Use the `local_laptop.sh` script to automate routine computational tasks, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

## Open to Contributions

Local Compute is an open-source project, and I welcome contributions from the community. Whether you want to enhance existing features, add new functionalities, or help with documentation, your contributions are greatly appreciated.

If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to fork the repository on GitHub and submit a pull request. You can also open issues if you find bugs or have suggestions for improvements.

## Conclusion

The Local Compute project aims to simplify the process of setting up a new PC.
