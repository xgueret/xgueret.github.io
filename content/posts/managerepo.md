## Introduction

I'm excited to introduce [Manage Repo](https://github.com/xgueret/manage-repo), a project designed to automate the creation, initialization, and management of GitHub repositories using Terraform. As a developer and DevOps enthusiast, I created this tool to streamline the process of setting up and managing repositories, allowing you to focus more on coding and less on configuration.

## Overview of Manage Repo

Manage Repo automates the entire process of creating a new repository on GitHub, initializing a local Git repository, and pushing the initial commit—all through the power of Terraform and Python. This project leverages the **Terraform** infrastructure as code tool along with the **integrations/github** provider to manage repositories programmatically.

Here’s what Manage Repo offers:

- **Automated Repository Creation**: Use Terraform to create a new GitHub repository, saving time and reducing the risk of manual errors.
  
- **Local Git Initialization**: Automatically set up a local Git repository and push the initial commit, ensuring your local environment is synced with the new GitHub repository.
  
- **Python Script**: The core of this project is written in Python, providing flexibility and ease of integration with other automation tools.

- **Terraform Integration**: By utilizing Terraform, the project allows for the management of repository settings and resources in a declarative and repeatable way. You also have the option to destroy the Terraform-managed resources when they are no longer needed.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of Manage Repo are to:

1. **Automate Repository Setup**: Streamline the process of creating and initializing GitHub repositories to save time and reduce the complexity involved in setting up new projects.

2. **Utilize Terraform for Infrastructure as Code**: Leverage Terraform to manage repository configurations and resources, providing a consistent and repeatable setup process.

3. **Python-Powered Flexibility**: Use a Python script to handle the execution of Terraform commands and the initialization of the local Git repository, offering an easy-to-use interface for automation tasks.

4. **Resource Management**: Allow users to easily destroy Terraform-managed resources when they are no longer needed, keeping their infrastructure clean and manageable.

## Open to Contributions

Manage Repo is an open-source project, and contributions from the community are more than welcome. Whether you want to improve the existing code, add new features, or help with documentation, your input is highly appreciated.

If you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork the repository on GitHub and submit a pull request. You can also open issues if you encounter any bugs or have ideas for enhancements.

## Conclusion

Manage Repo is designed to simplify and automate the management of GitHub repositories by combining the power of Terraform and Python. This project is ideal for developers and DevOps professionals looking to streamline their workflow and reduce manual setup time.
